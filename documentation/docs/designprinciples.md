1. Zero configuration by default

There is no configuration needed. You can extend defaults based on your application needs.

2. Feature parity with nextjs

Users of this component should be able to use nextjs development tooling, aka `next dev`. It is the component's job to deploy your application ensuring parity with all of next's features we know and love.

3. Fast deployments / no CloudFormation resource limits.

With a simplified architecture and no use of CloudFormation, there are no limits to how many pages you can have in your application, plus deployment times are very fast! with the exception of CloudFront propagation times of course.
