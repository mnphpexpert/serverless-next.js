A [serverless framework](https://serverless.com/) plugin to deploy nextjs apps.

The plugin targets [Next 8 serverless mode](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-8/#serverless-nextjs)

## Motivation

Next 8 released [official support](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-8/#serverless-nextjs) for serverless! It doesn't work out of the box with AWS Lambdas, instead, next provides a low level API which this plugin uses to deploy the serverless pages.

Nextjs serverless page handler signature:

`exports.render = function(req, res) => {...}`

AWS Lambda handler:

`exports.handler = function(event, context, callback) {...}`

A compat layer between the nextjs page bundles and AWS Lambda is added at build time:

```js
const page = require(".next/serverless/pages/somePage.js");

module.exports.render = (event, context, callback) => {
  const { req, res } = compatLayer(event, callback);
  page.render(req, res);
};
```

## Getting started

### Installing

`npm install --save-dev serverless-nextjs-plugin`

Edit the serverless.yml and add the plugin:

```yml
plugins:
  - serverless-nextjs-plugin
```

The plugin only needs to know where your `next.config.js` file is located. Note it expects the directory and not the actual file path. E.g. `./nextApp` where inside nextApp there is `next.config.js`.

```yml
custom:
  serverless-nextjs:
    nextConfigDir: "/dir/to/my/nextApp"
```

### REPLACE_WITH_DOCS_FOR_NEW_APPROACH

### Next configuration

In your `next.config.js` make sure the configuration is set like:

```js
module.exports = {
  target: "serverless",
  distDir: "build",
  assetPrefix: "https://s3.amazonaws.com/your-bucket-name"
};
```

`target: serverless`

This is a requirement for the plugin to work. When next has the target set to serverless, it will compile serverless page bundles.

`distDir: build`

Specify a `distDir`. Otherwise next will use the default value `.next` which breaks the Lambda deployment, probably because is a dot directory. `build` is fine, but could be any other name.

`assetPrefix: "https://s3.amazonaws.com/your-bucket-name"`

Other [valid bucket URLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingBucket.html#access-bucket-intro) are also fine.

The plugin will parse the bucket name from the `assetPrefix` and will create an S3 bucket using the parsed name. The first time the serverless stack is provisioned, it is assumed there isn't a bucket with this name already, so make sure you don't have a bucket with that name already in your amazon account. On deployment, the plugin will upload the next static assets to your bucket. Note that bucket names must be globally unique.

If you've reached this far, simply run:

`serverless deploy`

Visit the API GW endpoints and the next pages should be working ðŸŽ‰

## Examples

See the `examples/` directory.

## Roadmap

- Serverless functions created at build time, so users don't have to manually specify them in the `serverless.yml`.
- Mitigate cold starts, maybe just add an example using another plugin which solves this.
- More examples.

## Note

This is still a WIP so there may be breaking changes.

Any feedback is really appreciated. Also PRs are welcome :)
